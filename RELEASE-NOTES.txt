HEAD

* support virtio-scsi-pci so discard/fstrim will work
* cache option for disks
* workaround issue where adding a down device to a bridge can cause network interruption
* bridge ifup and ifdown changes
* renamed qemu-bridge script to qemu-ifup, so you need to update your apparmor profiles if you use them
* fixed issue with old name qemu-bridge, split into qemu-ifup and qemu-ifdown

1.0

* SYNTAX: changed "diskType=..." "cdType=..." defaults to be like the others: "disk_type=..."
* BUG: cd_type wasn't used properly
* started writing version numbers and tagging; x.y and if syntax changes, +1 to x, otherwise to y
* started writing release notes, intended to cover any config file syntax changes needed when updating
* added "drive_xxx=..." also, which applies to and is overriden by "disk_xxx=..." and "cd_xxx=..."
* added "baloon=1" option (but without anything to actually automate ballooning... probably not automatic in vanilla qemu)
