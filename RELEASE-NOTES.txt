1.0

* SYNTAX: changed "diskType=..." "cdType=..." defaults to be like the others: "disk_type=..."
* BUG: cd_type wasn't used properly
* started writing version numbers and tagging; x.y and if syntax changes, +1 to x, otherwise to y
* started writing release notes, intended to cover any config file syntax changes needed when updating
* added "drive_xxx=..." also, which applies to and is overriden by "disk_xxx=..." and "cd_xxx=..."
* added "baloon=1" option
